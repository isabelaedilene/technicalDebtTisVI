models/research/object_detection/,53,Note: This is largely a copy of _build_nasnet_base inside nasnet.py but,
models/research/object_detection/,54,with special edits to remove instantiation of the stem and the special,

models/research/object_detection/,74,start at 2.0 because 1 reduction cell has been created which would,

models/research/object_detection/,115,featurization. The reason for this is that nasnet.py only supports,
models/research/object_detection/,116,inputs with fully known shapes. We need to update nasnet.py to handle,
models/research/object_detection/,117,shapes not known at compile time.,
models/research/object_detection/,199,Note that both 'Cell_10' and 'Cell_11' have equal depth = 2016.,
models/research/object_detection/,203,nasnet.py does not maintain the batch size in the first dimension.,
models/research/object_detection/,204,This work around permits us retaining the batch for below.,
models/research/object_detection/,231,Note that we always feed into 2 layers of equal depth,
models/research/object_detection/,232,where the first N channels corresponds to previous hidden layer,
models/research/object_detection/,233,and the second N channels correspond to the final hidden layer.,
models/research/object_detection/,236,Note that what follows is largely a copy of build_nasnet_large() within,
models/research/object_detection/,237,nasnet.py. We are copying to minimize code pollution in slim.,

models/research/object_detection/,248,-- And add 2 for the stem cells for ImageNet training.,
models/research/object_detection/,271,This corresponds to the cell number just past 'Cell_11' used by,
models/research/object_detection/,272,by _extract_proposal_features().,
models/research/object_detection/,274,Note that this number equals:,
models/research/object_detection/,275,start_cell_num + 2 stem cells + 1 reduction cell,
models/research/object_detection/,310,Note that the NAS checkpoint only contains the moving average version of,
models/research/object_detection/,311,the Variables so we need to generate an appropriate dictionary mapping.,
